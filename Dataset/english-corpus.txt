i just got up
i was there yesterday
i am out of money

i didnt get his joke
he has long hair
he saved the princess
zains impossible
i must find out
somebody laughed
a dog is following us
she lied
i hope zain comes soon

she has lost weight
zain seems sweet
he came first
this story is true
the law was changed
i nearly died
i love french
i am a total wreck

i had a close shave
i hope so
i am not afraid at all
the sun fades colors
this is remarkable

i speak french
the man took my arm
i live in yokohama
she/he was tired of running about
i like milk
the train is out of sight now
my hobby is reading
do you have tuna fish
i got wet to the skin
that was serious
hand me the remote
zain sipped his drink
every bus is full
take everything
he has absolute power
can you forgive me
zain knows
are you hungry yet
zain has tonsillitis
you are cute
i feel like vomiting
she bought him a car
stop following me
give me what i want
everythings ready
that’s ok
he was born in
thats zains car
it was snowing
let me see
did zain tell you
there is no body inside
she was brave
i love my wife

i lack confidence
zain waved the flag
it saved our lives
zain has lost control
no one knew it
it is already eleven
you cant escape
as you please
zain wasnt married
i think you are nuts
i am having a blast
i am a college student
zain refuses to work
i postponed the event
tell me your plan
you are very lonely
he'll get there in ten hours
he walked quietly
there is no way left now
is tomorrow saturday
she had to accept her fate
its conceivable
you are so skinny
they arent here yet
i am feeling sleepy
trust me
he sells cars
does not matter
you were never alone
come along with us
that is a lie
were still together
i am going in first
zain led the attack
zain still hates mary
the axle is broken
did zain need help
mom is making a cake
zain has to go
i feel sorry for her

she cant afford it
his throat is swollen
he keeps on teasing me
zain leaned forward
the cat is black
they understood
i bought a red diary
were they lying
wheres the girl

the cats are meowing
he was shy at first
he is second to none
sugar is sweet
he will come tomorrow
he made up his mind
i dropped my sandwich
this is my husband
zains confessed

i am zains niece
zain is still in bed
zain is under the bed
zain told me
he will be pleased to meet you
i take my words back
i think you are wrong
i burned my finger
how late am i
i think you are nice
can i ask you something
my knee is bleeding
i knew too much
i am sad to hear it
do your homework
zain will starve
i feel it now
zain is blushing
go down
he made no response
i live in comfort
that is not your cup
you are an angel
i had like a soda
have zain come see me
zain is irresistible
zain abused our trust
i didnt listen
they are harmless
i cant talk now
he is still here
what did they want
shes gone on a trip
i hate this place
she isnt running
why do i even care
did zain forget to pay
zain is friendly
it sickens me
i made zain laugh
i ask you
its hopeless
i want to eat this
black is depressing
a man came to see him
are you joking
get to it tom
i no longer work here
take a purgative
what are your plans
i like his attitude
she came to my aid
idleness is the root cause of all ills
she loves children
it is a good cake
what vile behavior
you know i love you
i love monday
stop dreaming
this will pass
enjoy yourself
shall we begin
zain opened his eyes
are you alone now
live and learn
write tom
zain looks after us
we cant win
cheers
lets go away
look ahead
how have you been
zain is confused
why does ice float
forty people attended
do you believe him
he may miss his train
try to act your age
zain is intoxicated
he knows the secret
she prays for her parents
zain laughed
it looks like a ufo
all swans are white
i want my life back
i recognized his face
he is always laughing
zains voice was calm
we got married
the website is down
i have a few books
how old is this stuff

they are murderers
zain approached
zain ordered a beer
i really have to go
she has long hair

they play with those toys in their house
i dont mind waiting
that is an utter nonsense
we need to leave
i am not done with you
i need more blankets
i will surprise tom

you are the experts
zain is quite crazy
how sad

i traveled on foot
zain impressed me
thats a big problem
i am so cold

zain is an employee
he weighs kilos
i will think it over
we try our best
zains confused

i must be leaving now
you are successful
you will not be able to deal with him
it may be true
i am really upset

zain was distressed
get me out of here
he called me a cab
zain said goodnight
drive slowly

who wrote this poem
i hurt my shoulder
my mother is a nurse
we went to a superlative restaurant
we are doomed

zain isnt like me
do you feel better

you were happy
we cant lose
he is english
i am a romantic person
what happened here
i never saw her again
i wonder who they are
everyones busy
he used to read a lot
i like boys like that
this isnt legal

my dog needs a walk
i am the law
they were hungry
dont touch my camera
everybody needs one
what is wrong tom
zain didnt tell me
i owe you something
your skin is so soft
they wont find you
she has many friends
i like watching tv
we should sit down
its a cruel world
she picked up a coin
he lacks confidence
i am extremely sorry
can his story be true
i accept the offer
go to work tom
i like it
this is ugly
i wanted red shoes
zain was busy
i feel worse today
you are great
she kicked the door
i made a list
i am afraid of dogs
zain went pale
the light was on
they stopped walking
come back here
zain shut his eyes
she kicked him hard
i am listening to your rubbish only because of your father
lets see some id
tom asked mary why she was smiling
zain is a prisoner

why is sweat salty
do you have a moment
zain never listens
i am broke

chivalry isnt dead
zain was found guilty

they dont like me
dont be a snob
he often thinks with his eyes shut

she delivered her opinion
you were lucky
you broke the law
i cant even do that
i improvised
we had doubts

our dog seldom bites
you keep on talking all the time
we really did try
i was scared stiff
zain closed his eyes
he is an eye-witness
zain is very humble

no one gave up hope
i saw nothing at all
she died of cancer
i could kiss you
he is now on the phone
shut the door
is it far away
why are you asking
do you go there often
avoid bad company
it will have to wait
go to the tailor's shop on the way
go back to your work
zain was stubborn
weve all done it
would you like coffee or tea with your dessert
i am feeling hungry
he is wasted
i expect much of him
i go to work
my room is a mess
zain works hard
i dont need any help
i am not upset
i love this company
i found the box empty
do you remember
touch wood
dont lose heart
i remember seeing him
she tried to swim
is the water cold
advice is like salt
i couldnt agree more
he wrote the report
he is a very nice boy
my goals are modest
who listen
we kept chatting till late
you arent wrong
i am praying
you are realistic
everybody left
zain isnt stupid
are you friendly
it will soon be dark
i must obey tom
zain has many cats
i looked for the key
i couldnt stand it
zain has gray hair
i want one
i am very impressed
zain ripped me off
she needs our help
he is losing his looks
i got divorced
something went wrong
they are unreliable
consider it a gift
one of us is wrong
i love carrots
i work at an embassy
i always take the bus
thats all i can do
did zain forgive you
he is taking a walk
dont lie
i will watch tv
i saw him again
does it show
she went on a picnic
she kissed him
i cant keep this up
stay out of this
its rude to stare
what is this smell
he likes potato salad
who sells this
we met at a party
dont rip me off
will you help us
i am not the manager
its a curse
they are still young
zain died a hero
may god bless you!
i enjoy chess
i know nothing
try to open this door
don’t worry
i am at home
you cant stop now
it is too late
i worry about him
i resign
i have read the book
i paid attention
it hurts
she despised him
i am addicted
we will work tomorrow
i just moved in
lets draw straws
i enjoyed swimming
you go right ahead
you are humming
i will stay at home
was it good
i am drinking milk
i went to that party
i accept your apology
zain is paying a fine
i do want it
zain is very smart
he went into the bank
i am heating the room
i lost your number
are you scared of me
i bought a new car
i told zain a joke
god bless you
are they tall
none of it was real
give peace a chance
i reached my goal
he is brave and honest
i feel refreshed
is it cold outside
paper burns quickly
go kiss someone else
everyone is special
its under the table
we were here first
you look pale today
you are selfish
i have found it
zain needs mary
no comment
zain teaches yoga
i can die happy now
i found him the book
i love you
i cant imagine that
fix the watch
my father works here
diamonds are forever

i love flowers
the train doesn’t wait for anyone nor keep anyone waiting
lets try
they are my brothers

i had like to make a reservation
that hat becomes you
we need a timekeeper
who am i
i am not rich

she is stubborn
you are a bright boy
i am very tired now
she began to sweat

i am not coming today
how is it made
i am good
i'll call the restaurant and make a reservation
describe tom
it has to be done
they are our cars
i admire you
he has a second job
you are irresistible

i have a job for you
zain is uninsured
thats even better

i finally gave up
this is good news
shes not penniless
the suit becomes him
i will go
i pocketed my keys
zain came by earlier
zain stopped
i have hurt my toe
zain will sue you
can i have a moment
we just moved in
i am from kyoto
i shouldve stayed
i cant stand it
thanks for the pizza
i must see it
it’s none of you business
its hard
how are you today
dont be disappointed
zain is a firefighter
how does the film end
there is no going back
its zains decision
it’s ok for him, isn’t it
this is so dumb
you are a genius
stop hitting tom
the professor smiled
zain kneeled
we will see
all is calm tonight
its misleading
can you read this
he is such a jerk
everybodys safe
lets dance
he is mean
good evening
get on your knees
i loved zain very much
i am getting high
i am taking a bath
zain wore a hard hat
were undressing
who found you
i wish i had known
he married my cousin
i am tired of reading
who is that guy
i will buy a ford

she is a singer
everyone is different
zain lost patience
are you ten years old
which cold drinks do you have
put your gun down
i was born in russia
i love beef
is that unusual
zain paid a fine
i am just looking
i love that chair
zain wants you fired
that was a good time
i love being alone
were in a hurry
zain cooked dinner
he is still in bed
i am always optimistic
we may as we will wait
we cant help tom
i am very scared
youve gone too far
shes a knockout
he is friendly
i was a witness
nobody saw anything
when are you free
we will all die
take the garbage out
divide this in half
whos here
zain walked
i am really sorry
he looks younger than his age
my feet hurt
stop making such a noice
my wife cooks well
i brought some of my books to read
zain sent me there
zain will stop you
does that count
we talked until two
who will do it
zain wont come back
get off my lawn
he got ahead of me
zain says he is rich
zain cant leave now
you cant just leave
i did not have the heart to tell him the bad news
she married a sailor
i just emailed you
i think it will be ok
i am not a student
i am counting on you
zain is a shy boy
i think zain is lying
do you recognize it
zain wiped the table
they laughed at me
you are extraordinary
zain has a gun
do cows like milk
tomll understand
i dont like either tea or coffee
what do you mean
i hit it really hard
i have found the answer
zain had a grand time
where is my umbrella
i am very tired
zain wrote this book
i get the picture
cut off the power
my father isnt home
i gave him the book
its free
the dogs are wet
i was bored to death
he is crying
did you love me
take that down
i didnt see her
do you watch tv
i am going with tom
zain changed his mind
dont worry
i am just cleaning up
zains weird
he caught the chicken
zain lost the bet
this confectioner sells stale stuff
tomll remember
its very healthy
did i mention that
she does look tired
dont stand in my way
zain gave mary a wave
youve been deceived
zain is wearing a wig
leave town
zain remembered
write a short essay
read it once more
there is still hope
get away from here
zain opened the diary
do you have any pets
its time to sleep
they live nearby
i slapped his face
i will wait outside
zain is praying
they vanished
is that a crime
is she at home
remove the bandage
do kids like you
how does he do this
he has green eyes
do you wear glasses
i will love you forever
these arent my keys
she looks like an angel
everyones dead
do you like juice
were trying
what is the catch
did zain have a gun
i want to stay here
this isnt about you
the clock is fast
i left you a message
a horse is an animal
zain chickened out
this is no joke
i have learned so much
its for my family
she rode a camel
this is simple
he is on the team
my dog is big
how do i get there
you are famous
dont look at me
he often watches tv
zain died from tb
i left my wife
stay cool
i want a new kitchen
making this decision was challenging for me
why are we running
congratulations
i had a heart attack
he shouts a lot
keep an eye on tom
i lost my glasses
be polite but firm
i dont get it
they will cut down on their expenses
that person died
what is eating her
i went to the store
his bicycle is blue
i am a little nervous
plucking flowers is prohibited
its grotesque
it will be a big day
we are who we are
is it a recent picture
is my answer correct
the dictionary on the desk is mine
your fly is open
this door is locked
i made it myself
i love ice cream
zain took a week off
would you like any wine with that
why are you alone
dont miss the bus
i didnt order fish
he is paraplegic
i dont understand
where does this road lead to
walking is nice
you never asked me
they are quiet
he never loses hope
i like tandoori chicken very much
zain begged for mercy
do you have a motto
of course
i am zains mother
turn of the fan
i am afraid he is ill
how many dependents have you here
you let me down
this is my book
were not surprised
its only a dream
zain will be thrilled
that had be impossible
lets have sushi
are these your things
he cannot be a poet
i didnt kill anyone
we need this
i had to stay home
i am not accepting anything else at this time
you are pathetic
i did it
i have sisters
zain needs new shoes
weve forgiven you
you lost an earring
i know everybody here
i like to catch flies
i cleaned the house
i have heard nothing
stop trying
i am a doctor

zain is irritated
i didnt like it
were you busy
this is very easy
i dont like coffee

zain talked all night
i couldnt help it
zain wants to try it
what have we done
i am dancing

love doesnt exist
what do you like the most
zain was very unlucky
wish me luck
i think i can do it
i knew youd go there
zain stayed
we basically agree
here she is
zain is the chief
zain is a grown man
stop moving
i had one last hope
you must stay awake
prices are rising
you can answer it
zain robbed a bank
live and let live
its my treat
i paid my bills
we werent lucky
this desk is good

she is an expert
zain lost his way

zain was very lucky
i want to talk to him
i wish you good luck

zain has gone mad
i need zains money
i abhor violence
i have got the keys
zain doesnt have tea
i cant die here

you should meet him
i am a bit hungry
he fell backward
why are you limping

i kept my mouth shut
i will assist tom
thats not fair
i can hardly hear you
were hiding
zain surrendered
stop correcting me
how many plates do you want
i swim once a week
i have two cousins
please give me a hug
it might be too late
i can drive a car
everyone noticed
the boy began to cry
look its snowing
he hasnt come yet
look at these photos
zain turned serious
you should rest
you can use this car
i think zain is kind
i slept on the boat
i will come by car
zain is my neighbor
please reconsider
you live and learn
i am hiding
hello everyone
zain said that
i am glad you like it
its for tom
why did this happen
he is dieting
i just took a shower
i am dead serious

i will take the chance
i like being with you
where are you hiding

you seem pretty busy here
i understand that
you are conceited
stop tickling me
dont talk nonsense
this is very helpful
we will be home soon
i use it every day
wed better find it
he was a rugby player
dont make a scene
dont call him now
why do stars twinkle
can you do handstands
i am just lucky
he is far from happy
i think you are stupid
honey doesnt spoil
i am not forgetful
a cop was killed
you are good at this
my hair is so dirty
were exhausted
what is he up to now
i lost my umbrella
i need some nutmeg
its lunch time
i can prove it to you
weve already met
i love french movies
such a foxy mind you have
my sister is famous

i voted for you
zain is gullible
who built it
i can hardly breathe
what is your contact number
you may rely on him
i will drive you home
zains elderly
zain works long hours
we want to come back
was that your plan
we saw everything
they handcuffed tom
i would not blame them
all we can do is wait
were with the cia
i am not hungry
zain asked something
is zain all right
i let the cat in
i found the book easy
she forgave him
zain is playing golf
thats not normal
thats a great story
zain lied to us
dont make noise here
utilities are extra
zain drove
i dont like this one
zain stole the money
there were two left
i was listening to the news on the radio
we don’t love flying kites
he studied hard
my shoulders hurt
thanks for the help
can he see us
it is freezing cold
it was a stupid bet
i am from croatia
how about tonight
go have a beer
they stopped singing
i found zains diary
close the door
his hands were empty
i think i understand
my cat loves milk
i have got to call tom
this is not a game
he pushed me gently
the babys awake
do you have a pencil
he looks very tired
how does it look
i cant do this alone
he works as a busboy
i say it all the time
i am grilling fish
help is on its way
i am nervous now
somebody answered
is zain celebrating
i want a raise
he loves to gossip
he seems hungry
he started swearing
i dont want to go
can i ask why not
he is a slacker
what a mess
she looked sad
he knows how to fight
i have failed
that makes sense
i bought a new suit
he has ten cows
he is good at singing
i hate reptiles
he is not there
i refused at first
wolves dont usually attack people
is she staying at a hotel
all is quiet
i like her
zain passed away
hell be here again
do not wait for me, if i am late to presentation
i trust you
you need to grow up
zain was also there
he was nearly drowned
i just dont know what to say
who vanished
this is just water
it is a matter of sorrow
i drank some wine
your nose is running
zain was at home
i will go get changed
i’d like to go for a walk
i am sorry
they were sleeping
that is enormous
i have to help mary
love knows no limits
i see your house
i hope he is all right
take off your coat
we could get caught
it cant be that bad
shake hands with him
be calm
hell understand
i am ready to begin
i cannot agree with your opinions
what is your location
how old is your cat
i am the guilty one
he can barely read
let me see that list
do you want something
thats not necessary
from time to time
zain is a recluse
tomll quit
i make breakfast
would you like that
we generally sing songs all together
i dont want sugar
she is happy
did they fire you
zain is daydreaming
i just couldnt sleep
i was confused
i can do this myself
this pizza is cold
this is disturbing
a thing is valued where it belongs
he crushed my hopes
turn it off tom
time to get up
i go to school
i am here to help
he asked after you
i agree
trust no one
he is a naughty boy
i locked the door
zain died a happy man
they arent hungry
i know him very well
zain needs your love
it wasnt personal
i cant contact tom
thats your decision
do you like that song
thats a pretty tune
stand up
how did you guys meet
i volunteered

lets wait here
this work is not suitable for you
i am a redhead
i am screaming
they are my cousins
i don’t want
i was lying
i will keep watch
we are angry of guilty of his action
nobody was listening
he worked very hard

we had no choice
wholl start
we are going to split the bill
thatll never change
i am at home
zain voted
zain likes snow
i do hope so
you may laugh at me
this is very simple
had he asked me, i would have stayed
here is your food
did somebody hit you
he is not feeling well

i hope you understand
he always plays well

i will come help you
his word is law

zain is just adorable
zain is a tall man

zain is a moron

i know your son
zain is scary
i have three cameras
what did i just do
where will you go
he is a married man
he ran up the stairs
i am a nurse
they will find me
i saw the pictures
her speech bored me
i felt out of place
that was a close one
i have no idea 
i need to sleep now
its all i want
i like to sing songs
i am right
even zain was baffled
zain is your teacher
the pantry was empty
i should learn french
they agree
zain has an iphone
i will call him tonight
zain seems harmless
shes older than him
zain cant see you
i am not even canadian
he is not my boyfriend
it was a nightmare
he learns fast
now is the time
here is my wallet
you may go at once
when will you return
she turned him down
he is eight
i have seen that too
come with me
zain was gullible
she talks a lot
it was unbelievable
whose pens are these
zain had a dog
this watch needs to be repaired
we were all worried
i think zain is lonely
where is she
this isnt my bag
can you do that again
i have got no friends
is that for me
everyone else is fine
its been tried
i will show you my room
who hired you
hang on a minute
did zain believe it
what did you miss
i am lonely
did that surprise you
i had like to watch tv
i am going to jump
i always take a bus
the students laughed
i shook my head
i changed my mind
i deserve more
the area was a popular tourist haunt
we will go
why did you call me
its hot today
was the soup tasty
that isnt my fault
zain has no choice
i am very pleased to meet you
its an emergency
i felt bad afterwards
do you have a lighter
you looked scared
they adopted a kid
there is plenty of rubbish in the kitchen
are you anxious
zain shouldve called
i was very tired
could we have a fork
he was very happy
we will give it a shot
there is no sense in it
where is room
i seldom walk to work
its all mine
he is kind at heart
thats how it is
nice to see you
i relied on him
what are friends for
i like playing tennis
i hid under the table
he is a good athlete
its boiling in here

i'll be back soon
timing is everything
it looks like rain
that would never happen to me
thanks for the milk
i miss her a lot
zain is going
is the color fast?
you are old
this is not normal
how deep is this lake
talk sense
each player did his best
his eyes are sore and watering
i like to be early
it isnt a secret
zain seemed upset
i live in kobe
she hates running
my father became old

i am tired
they became nervous

i am still busy
zain was tired
i sat beside her
zain is wasting time

she gave him the car
i used to be lazy

zain put his shirt on
i had nowhere to hide
they all looked up

i hate dogs
its right above you
i forgot my password
it cannot be true
zain found that

he is lying on the bench
these are my parents
what did you want to order
dont act surprised
what did she say
i dont know her
i wont do that again
his socks are gray
everythings changed

we walked to my room
i opened the door
my mother is angry
this cant be right
he was heartbroken

i was at school
zain got rich quickly
zain had a plan
my name is taimoor

thats the way it is
who are you angry at
its all toms
maybe you are right
this table is costly
lets do the dishes
i can wait no longer
shut off the water
he is old and crazy
he is a bit shy
you could ask tom

i still love him
the towels are dirty
he is not so tall

this is difficult
she has forgiven him
i drank tea yesterday
he is extremely happy

zain relaxed
silence is half consent

zain got mad
zain stopped digging
they always complain
what made you late
years passed
zain relaxed his grip
dont wait for me
this glass is dirty
is that a bus or car
zain signed the check
he is looking at you
this is your chance
draw me a sheep
tom had a great time
zain appears confused
fasten your seatbelts
i am not english

i met her by accident
i recently met tom
he sketched an apple
i was afraid of that
they disappeared
he gave me a bad cold
i dont deserve it

he burst out laughing
does it taste good
zain recovered
help is on the way
thanks for that
i think you know why
i dont know exactly
he cannot be trusted
i like sashimi

roses smell sweet
zain looks very young
we looked for her
we need a plan first
but first you have to earn it by helping this tourist who just arrived in town
i know you love me
somebody help me
the pan is too hot
i am taking off now
the food is cold
can you guess my age
why did you leave
you must work
we are too drunk
zain has windows
i came here yesterday
he seldom gets angry
its really annoying
i recognized the name
he teaches arabic
you cant have both
let me handle tom
i stopped smoking
i am in your debt
zain is a traitor
he is too sensitive
sorry to be late

my head really aches
zain scored points
i have made a discovery

his son is a genius
if you need my help, please let me know
she is unconscious
should we go
he is an oceanographer
how long will it take
what are you doing here
do you feel up to it
i agree to his plan
he keeps a cat
life is unfair
zain seems impatient
he betrayed you
i agreed to buy it
i dont eat fish

he asked me to
he speaks russian
i am almost finished
lower your gaze
shut your eyes
how lucky you are
i’ve an upset stomach
this isnt normal
we cant let zain die
they know were here
zains amazed
he stayed up late
how many people died
zain is in shock
the case is closed
you have no match
is he looking
please wait to be seated
dont let go
he is a good speaker
he is a bit of a loner
zain is a guard
a fish can swim

you owe me a kiss
i care about that
my father is out
i think i am drunk
thats a cheap store
how clever
zain exercised
they just left
i want this phone
i purchased one bag
is it worth the risk
he wore old shoes
i am a monk
the floor was cold
you drive too fast
this is my house
everybody loves her
zain made his bed
we have to save tom
let me look into it
turn down the radio
i feel sad without you
i blacked out
he visited a friend
he writes books
he was speaking
i am not busy
you know i am wrong
zain wanted to stay
i have a dog
i will think over this matter
the dog is dead

zain kept singing
my neighbor is nice
youve got my keys
you are winning
he is my close friend
zain likes blondes
do you need a lift
what will you charge for two dozen oranges
he is lying
i eat with my hands
zain is too picky
you havent changed

my aunt lives with her daughter
she was livid
we know what we want
i feel like dancing
zain is wrong
it is too long ago
i will be back
its bizarre
i know where she is
my suit is gray
zain lacks experience
you cant ignore tom
girls arent welcome
i read books
i can hardly walk

zain couldnt stop
he is still at work
he leaned towards me
she made him do it
he is lame of one leg
drop your gun
you cant blame him
are you honest
i have a solution
you cant help tom
mary is not my type
tom pretended he was sick
i slept like a baby
he aimed at the bird
he wrote a letter
i wont confirm it
i am getting used to working late at night
the man was given a life sentence
cherish this moment
zains sleeping
are you guys hungry
do you hear that
you reek of alcohol
how would you feel
he is always cheerful
hang on to it
he is very stingy
i have got two brothers
they believe in god
we all make mistakes
i found her kind
i got up early
dont break
the boys are fine
i dont want a horse
i have a better idea
zain is full of life
they will find tom
the meat is tough
let me do that
i have three dogs
i had nothing to say
i am not so lucky
you are everything to me
show it to tom
you are too late
somehow zain knew
you are quiet
dogs can swim
you are dreaming
i hate spinach
its cold out there
i am getting old
he was busy
what will you make
please dont be mad
do not tempt me
thats correct
zain was dirty
that was different
zain ruined my life
we will walk
what a dignified man
zain wont like you
please say yes
zain didnt flinch
bring him in
we are happy
we were all asleep
i share your opinion
my parents are dead
i would enjoy that
i will take care of it
she smokes a lot
what a lovely dress
trust your gut
my sister is a nurse
do you speak latin
i woke up late this morning
someone is lying
no one was late
she worships him
please dont mumble
i saw him first
come on lets try it
i am in a good mood
they should thank me
its a big world
it will be spring soon
i can't do this to tom
it doesnt matter
i have lost my cap
dont ask
thats saturn
you are not a suspect
the house was silent
what is this made of
you cant go yet
they are cannibals
that was our plan
the party was a flop
its bad for you
champagne please
zains lucky
he lost his sight
i am making a movie
zain knows the family
when do you study
he cannot have said so
its my only hope
shes my classmate
come soon
what does zain expect
i am being picked up
where were you today
time once lost cannot be regained
zain doesnt know why
what will we eat
we got up at dawn
its just not enough
i am used to waking up early in the morning
it wont be that bad
i wish that were true
please stop singing
why didnt you call
its wrong to lie
birds fly
zain is mad at mary
are you still there
is this your purse
we have been waiting a long time
do i need to add salt
i cant walk
i felt very sleepy
were in mourning
zain felt fine
what is your analysis
this cant be true
zain jumped overboard
i have learned to cook
she is about my age
may i interrupt
shes my first love
zip up
thats no surprise
dont be so angry
did zain call you
are you here
you are not my type
we must pay taxes
he is no saint
you betrayed me
i cant blame you
it has to stop
were dancing
i burnt my fingertip
who do you talk to
it was unavoidable
i need some fresh air
we are looking forward to seeing you soon
zain has been wounded
he has no remorse
i will go get the broom
what does zain do
i felt isolated
i had like you to drive
i do not mean it
start counting
no thank you
this is all i know
zain misses his wife
i want my own room
that explains a lot
i am so fat
i didnt order this
we caught the thief
i have a small fever
he is afraid of dogs
tastes differ
he is not a bad guy
its cold in here
listen to this tape
his body is covered with boils
i got soap in my eyes
look back
he should be angry
do you trust zain yet
sorry to bother you
he pushed past me
zain says hello
i owe you nothing
she is a teacher
he drank a beer
so what else is new
any news
zain raises orchids
i am a bit confused
did you find a job
how did you meet tom
i am persevering
keep it warm
draw the certain
his head ached
you drive
i need you to listen
i want to marry her
i love pandas
zain finished
sharing is important
i need lots of time
zain isnt here yet
can you help us
zain trusts mary
our country is rich in marine products
nobody likes war
were even
sit down
she will come soon
she attacked him
my brother is a vet
if water reaches 100 degrees, it boils
he is now on his own
is that even legal
he eats a lot
fetch me my hat
do you speak english
thats tom
he arrived late
your dog is here
we will find the truth
lets see
beware of pickpockets
i bowed politely
zain is obnoxious
meet me at the from entrance
she feels bad today
she has short hair
i'll explain the incident
we are out of danger
i have
i am weighing myself
keep walking
my life has changed
grab an umbrella
i have seen that
ignorance is bliss
zain has bad eyesight
are you catholic
he made me do it
zain will wait
it is beautiful
its not that simple
i will return at
his speech bored me
mary plays the piano
he was absorbed in thought
i bought a few stamps
she has blue eyes
good evening
zain works at a bank
zain bent forward
he is just arrived
i am patient
its really simple
zain has already won
its admirable
i want zain to succeed
thats for you
who broke this
yolks are yellow
zain is a picky eater
zain hoisted the flag
zain asked me out
i remember seeing her
zain can answer that
did zain have a plan
how absurd
is there an elevator
please be patient
his house is for sale
were partners
welcome
zain isnt boring
why is it that you are always late
it may break
she is getting on
will the police come
i am a professor
we can look it up
he is smart
i will ask tom
this wood wont burn
you were so sweet
its not an issue
are you overweight
i tried everything
zain understood that
he is sure of winning
i suppressed a yawn
i saw the movie
zain wanted revenge
i hate everyone
i handed him a map
dont look
zain is kind to mary
going out with friends is fun but it can also be exhausting sometimes
i am fond of reading
money is needed
a cow has a long tail
dont be childish
were divorced
i hate winter
she kept quiet
where is the cat
a loud knocking at the door woke him up
zain coughed loudly
you are so slacker
zain is untrustworthy
she is teaching me
his name was tom
dont you like us
thats too expensive
do you like the piano
zain is vague
he is scared of dogs
is zain doing okay
may i come aboard
get out of my house
i couldnt lie to you
i no longer love you
your shoes are here
i got a lot to say
were the new owners
i ran like the wind
what did you guys do
will he ever do it
my shoes are brown
i am looking for you
who is that
i was at my wits end
everyone loves him
do you like swimming
which beer is yours
what is there to eat
the patient is not out of danger yet
zain is reading
she failed to appear
i only need tom
i know how to fly
tell me what you see
they won
please be seated
a rose's petals are very delicate
she isnt picky
did you feel pleasure last night
how deep is lake biwa
when will he come
no one told me
water is important
i think zain is honest
i am not sure
did zain try
i begged zain to stay
it was too easy
what is your opinion
i am from tokyo
i said many things to him
zain came home by bus
i have to wear boots
zain is good at cards

she advised him to get more exercise
he knows how to bet

zain was perplexed

i am not scared at all
i need a little help
he is blinded by love
zain has a sore knee
i saw the message
i am not like tom
zain put on an apron
how fast did zain run

zains crazy
i have buck teeth
they are everywhere
you look amazing
i wanted to cry
zain was obedient

did you get a haircut
it will be dark soon
can you pick it up
this cake is sweet
when are you free
he is innocent
zain owes me money

it was a bad movie
i heard it
zain just kept eating
did zain laugh
we must obey
i have a lot to do
of course

she lives nearby
he is a born artist
i fall asleep
brush your teeth
you know what i mean
he has a long neck
i do feel pretty good
the woman is fat
zain is a tough guy
zain began crying
let me explain why
did the dog bark
i don’t know how to play chess
what is bugging you
i refuse to do it
this seems unlikely
i am often half asleep
i got a new camera
i remember her telling me they were leaving
i felt like screaming
i prefer coffee
i should go now
how is your cold
mary is very pretty
defend yourselves
zain hasnt come yet
everyone is ready
his jokes amused me
time is money
he shot at me
zain wants you to eat
you are inconsiderate
we must work faster
lets go to my place
i nearly got killed
thats my suitcase
zain will arrive soon
i bought this sweater yesterday
why are you crying
the car didnt move
zain trusted me
my back hurts
zain is our son
why do you love me
i cant see anything
i let in the cat
we are watching tv
who allowed him in
there were seven dishes at their party
how about your place
this was no accident
he is her friend
zain turned scarlet
i was too drunk

he gave me a wink
zain has strong hands
i am not angry at you

he is an actor
its very bitter
do you want him
its beyond reason
i wasnt dreaming
i am not a psychic
i am a suspect
zain is full of hope
i know what its like

i asked zain to help
you are worried

he never laughs
i am married
zains alive

shes very beautiful
his dad calls him tom

i am pulling the plug
that question is easy to answer
zain broke his nose
when did you retire
i don’t need you
i am very afraid
run for it
its a new day
zain sweated
could we have a spoon
who broke the vase
is he correct
its your home
i wasnt in a hurry
nobody listens
zain baked a pie
our plan worked
he raised a question
i feel their pain
bring some tissues
i know where you live
there is one catch
that is our school
zain is on his way in
i am not alone
crime doesnt pay
i have come to save tom
she looks young
i dont care
you got away with it

learning about new cultures and places is fascinating and enriching
you are uninsured
i am to go

did zain win the race
it was the only way
i have a credit card
maybe zain was wrong
zain looked good
mary is a fox
it is cold outside
when are they coming
golf is boring
he is a thief
zain blames us

europe is a continent
i am more than happy
i told zain the truth
i think zain should go
zain likes chocolate
stay a while
did you ever try
i hate dancing

i understand
it was my turn
my stomach hurts
i am friends with her
i saw him

this is just stupid
thats so juvenile
he gave in
shes only a child
you cheated
she wrote one letter
the boy ran away
zain has three cats

you are fair
you are afraid of him
zain needs help

love will find a way

how can we save tom
this coat fits you
were not in danger
i looked for a job
is it that hard
its sort of strange
go find tom
zain collects comics
gambling is illegal
i do not like spring
zain is available
i am allergic to cats
its just a game
the fridge is empty
i sent you a letter
i didnt read it all
i am from tokyo japan

shut your big mouth
i want some of those
he gave me a watch
zain is in his room

might makes right
he was tired so he went to bed
you are too late

i felt relieved

did zain bribe mary
could we get the bill
i am quite wealthy
can you swim
i dont remember
were you born here
he is intelligent
i almost cried
you are funny
ask him
open the bottle
zain needed work
zain respects mary
can i borrow your car
thats sufficient
its one oclock
are you a wizard
i often read books
zain said nothing
there is no more salt
you mustnt touch it
she despises him
go yourself
i would like to order my food now
may i ask a question
we will soon find out
i dont fear death
i am a shy boy
you wont be shot
they have turned on us
did you poison tom
i cant stay for long
were doomed
i don’t know
he drew a deep breath
there is a snag
i guess its true
are you guys crying
i wrote it myself
what does it mean
thats embarrassing
stop smoking
how was zain killed
he is coming closer
i believe in magic
the sea is blue
every seat was full
wow its hot today
i stayed up all night
zain looks busy
zain is very unlucky
i am extremely happy
he married an actress
you are very rude
were going to fight
she danced with him
thats not easy
hurry up
can i have water with my meal
i highly doubt that
she is his friend
come on lets go
he can swim well
let me die
zain baked bread
he crossed his legs
i am unemployed

how did you find us
i think zain is asleep
tell me you love me
zain is so happy
thats been tried

he denied the rumor
go to school
all i want is you
i will do the talking
i serve no one
its dark
i was so unhappy then
zain can come too
i am unprejudiced
i cant find my watch
it was a stupid idea
i am on duty now
zain was so careful
i hope zain comes
zain has curly hair
i dont envy you
i am here to save you
this is zains room
we dont have to go
he is alone
i refuse to answer
i caught them kissing
zain is afraid
i am not uncomfortable
it’s all you do
where can we buy it
these arent real
zain can get them
wind up the clock
its happened to me
you startled us
are you home
everyone has problems
zain died suddenly
did zain sing
we cant escape
i am not dead
i know zains sister
do you need a break
he has a hat on
you dont know me
i could barely sleep
i will get the others
so i do
this book will do
zains car is gone
that comes in handy
the switch is on
i didnt expect you
we made it on time
their eyes met
how much do i owe you
we need to get help
this makes me so mad
perhaps you are right
the tactic worked
i found you
i am not a soldier
its hip and trendy
they are innocent men
rabbits love carrots
i baked an apple pie
zain is very open
lets go by taxi ok
i want to sing a song
just be yourself
i hid it under my bed
it takes time
are you ok
i will ask around
were not strangers
zain isnt helpful
zain gave me the key
i weigh pounds
she has faults too
it is dark outside
he is an undergrad
close all the windows
zain is always hungry
he was unimpressed
he went abroad
zain surprised mary
you can park here
i am just lazy
please have your dinner with me
we havent met yet
zain is angry with us
would you like dessert after your meal
i could not recognize you
take mine
zains smart
i caught a cold
zain opened the safe
when did i do that
it is must to try
what is in the fridge
thank you for being brave enough to let me in
is zain stupid

zain seated himself
i will come back later
how youve grown
i need some water
i have always loved you
this is a trap
i can teach english
i am a muslim
i feel dizzy
i fed the dog
zain was here too
i was devastated
i owe her yen
i will stay home
it matters
we knew no one
give me an example
he is very skeptical
dont run risks
i was tempted
are you sure of that
did he say that
i am stunned
i love snow
zain didnt like that

i had like to pay
zain is standing
his teeth were white
i am making tea
she blackmailed him
i am great at advice
thats my plan
i wish i understood
its unusual
their cakes are good
i have already tried
zain is mistaken
he offered to help me
i am only doing my job
she is quite angry
you need to explain that to me again
zain wanted mary

they need new shoes
whos standing
she made me smile
i lost a bet

zain was bored
zain is on the plane
you are very sweet
he sat on the bench

zain wasnt surprised
we looked up
i dont want to share

i come from america
please wrap it up

zains imaginative
its rainy today

we dont know her
shes at a meeting
dont take water on an empty stomach
how was your trip
zains sad
zain has three cars
i love old books
we need it badly
i must help her

our kids hate us
zain needs our advice
this is all my fault
he lives in comfort
the man is old
you can keep it
when was she born

life is interesting
i have seen it a lot
she may not come
my eyes hurt
watch closely

he is probably wrong
what is that smell

maybe i was wrong
might is right
i wish i was like him
he did it for fun
as i was free i went there
he is a work horse
zain saw something
you knew i knew
lets keep it
does she know you
let me do it my way
the plane takes off in ten minutes
let me call tom
i am not sleepy
hold on to it
are you angry with me
breathe in deeply

i took a week off
we are not alone
he asked me to do it
i wish i'd married another man
i found the building
could we pay please
this coat is tight for me
did zain threaten you
i have insurance
we missed the exit
he cant do that
his eyesight is bad
youll feel better
she is used to getting her way
thats terrible
thats evident
we study chinese
i had never say that
she made him cry
she looks very happy
i used to love her, but not anymore
zains a great actor

the bird flew away
i must do it now
i have asked everybody

lets live here
i had like a beer
its pretty simple
thats a blue house
there was music
i take it back
wheres zains stuff
she looks very sick
they ruined my life
zain denied the rumor
my son is not a snob
i am harvesting wheat
i am building a wall
she smiled
weve tried that
its far from here
he has guts
i cant stop you
he gave up cigarettes
dont open your book
that was very funny
you are irresistible
zains annoyed
we chartered a bus
we are not amused
zain is wicked
grief drove her mad
why are you at home
what do you remember
i had a flu shot
i love my plants
you seem stressed
is zain ill
you are cantankerous
swimming is my hobby
i enjoy reading
she surprised me
he will be here soon
wheres zain today
i can live with that
zain is an art dealer
i feel terrible today
they stayed friends
he is a tough cookie
it was a blow to us
i never doubted that
i like pizza

zain is shopping
i have been busy
i know a shortcut
weve hired tom
i am with the fbi

the temperature will come down tomorrow
you are confusing tom
zain likes fish
i want an apple
both of you are right
there goes our bus
it must be true
i hate losing
that was no ordinary storm
the game is over
i was correct
it matters to me
you have changed
he looked for the key
be punctual and attentive
all the money is gone
did i miss anything
i wish i were wrong
this is pathetic
i will admit i am wrong
zain is rather weak
what do we owe tom
we have two sons
i want to play
zain likes to read
you got shot tom
you are a workaholic
are you married all
my pulse is slow
were not done yet
nobody came
she seems excited
she didnt answer

my pen is new
he misses his family
he speaks french
they crept forward
you don’t seem to agree with me
i am on the eighth floor

everyones watching
i was in the mountains
i love this video
we count on you
does that help
i bought an old car
i forgot to ask him

the spoon is dirty
i am not sure why
this is ridiculous
this isnt helping
i want my mommy
are you ambitious
you cant scare me

he has no children
i know all of them
i cant see you
everything changed
i am sure he will come
isnt that the truth
he may come anytime

i guess the dog bites
i am sick
thats a relief
his life is in danger
zain saw it
there is no way out
he talked to himself
my sister works at the theater

you couldve died
zain had a bad dream

that surprises me
zain wont starve
i talked about music

i am not afraid of you
zain is a beginner
zains filthy

zain remained silent
it will soon be spring
i started to worry

i forbid you to smoke
i stared at the man
it will cost me my job
i had loads of fun
how did zain respond

i have a lot of work to do
i think i may vomit
its worth a fortune
zain became blind
he is very honest

he has a dark secret
is reservation necessary at that restaurant
this bird cannot fly
i am glad i hired you
you are replaceable
the noise bothers me

i live a simple life
thats my idea
what if he is wrong

did zain come home
you can't back out on me now
zain understood
is zain still playing
i will find another job
i am attentive
i go to bed at eleven
does she have a hobby

zain is holding it
i shall try my best to handle the situation
i am not joking
open your mouth wide
you all right
enough is enough
two chapattis were not enough for me
zain succeeded
it was almost funny
zain wanted money
i had to keep moving
zain turned quickly
she picked flowers

you can do it tom
he came to my rescue

zain says he is unsure
i was busy all day

zain left me the keys
the clock is ticking

i put up my umbrella
what i did was wrong
what does she do
be attentive

thats a copy
i am your conscience
he saw it too
he attempted suicide
i can give it a shot
i am probably wrong
did zain drown
there is no sugar
zain washed his face
i called zain today
i never go anywhere
they are interns
dont spill the soup
ice melts in the sun
i cant afford a car
they let me go
she is very busy

we cant turn back
i feel your pain
i got up about five
the sheer weight of visitors is destroying this tourist attraction
you are now an adult
i do agree with tom
nobody loves me
the crowd went wild
you look relieved
you might be correct
i decline that
tom always wants something
dont smoke in bed
i like that young man
did he hit you
you dont need that
ask him his name
zain was in agony
she loves to fish
is he your teacher
i gave him a call
tom survived the car crash
no one loves me
everybody lies
zain misses boston
did you make coffee
thats a lot
i feel very sick
zain is in denial
her plan is dangerous

zain watched mary eat
its delicious
i am just watching tv
i have bought a car

they wont make it
i am your father
i shouldve told tom
you can count on me

i will sleep in my room
you are young
zain knows that
the cup was empty
i dont have a pencil
zain bought a car

they laughed quietly

zain trusts me
he is very careful
was the bank closed
that was pathetic
i am sorry that i misheard you
what are they doing
zain has my book
do you want to sing
the curtain rose
fill up the tank
may i get you anything to drink
zain is never on time
he is afraid of dogs
zain seems insincere
you are hurting me
what would happen
i had like to see her
we canoed downstream
we abhor violence
try to guess
zain laughed heartily
it has rained excessively today
anyone can do that
there is no harm in meeting him
zain is a new student
the restaurant offers a wide variety of local specialities
you all right
he disappeared
how do you like that
i didnt say that
does your wife know
here they come
zain is an old friend
we were wrong
thats sweet of you
i was asked to lie
is this it
you must help us
i am good, and you
were at home

it was dark by then
i don’t speak very well
a leaf is falling
i will pick him up at
you dont look well

my life was a wreck
they hurried to the station
you are nervous
zain is lean and tall
i had fun here
we are his children

this car is like new
i have no patience
we elected her mayor
can you come tomorrow
i was in the library
he twisted my arm
this is very bad
i want to eat pizza
zains tough
does zain wear boots
can you eat these
why is zain hiding
why are you so ugly
my watch is ten minutes slow
shes a belly dancer
would you step aside
read this first
i dont think i snore
keep a cool head
they were soldiers
what did zain know
you did a great job
i heard that happen
you have done well
mary is a party girl
zain meant well
i wanted to make some telephone calls
we cant outrun them
zains dog bit mary
i really need it
zains dying
put down the knife
zain made me eat it
isnt she a knockout
i have always liked tom
he attained his goal
zain loves mary
i cant risk it
i dreamt about you

you are safe in here
i am sore all over
i study english

i have blonde hair
i have seen you on tv
zain was alone
he is a heroin addict
where is the boy

zain studied hard
he fired but missed
watch the road
i need to pull up my pant
you are important
i am busy today
zain took a picture
you are a genius
i am going to flea market
i'll return immediately	
please choose wisely
boston is my home now
zain grew a mustache

i rarely listen to the radio
zain let us all down
zain is almost thirty
a whale is a mammal
he wont listen to me
there are exceptions
i am not married
i have tennis elbow

i like your car
it doesn’t matter
is it a coincidence
i will work alone
zain has a hangover

this isnt mine
thats fair enough
i have seen them
may i join you
wow thats great
zain knows mary lied

zain changed jobs
thats all for today
i must get it fixed

frogs eat flies
i am poor at drawing
it was my fault
she was crying
zain slept late
what bring you here
i didnt kiss anyone
try to remember
keep zain busy
he has a nice income
are you fit
i did it a few times
i wont lose
i cant do it anymore
i liked that book
zain allowed me to go
just stay close
did she sleep well
you are impatient
thats good advice
is it sweet or sour
what did you wear
why did you run away
youd better leave
zain was smoking
how was your flight
i believe in ghosts
its quite large
take over
i am bored
they made a promise
she is fond of cake
show me the money
they cheered
i just made it
you are decisive
it will grow back
rabbits have long ears and short tails
that was zains fault
my decision is final
we value punctuality
i am sorry about that
they hate each other
it is rusted
zain went to harvard
i didnt mean to yell
his family is large
this book was new
dont talk so loud
i am afraid for you
zain lacks empathy
tom won't let you go
give me the knife
this is useless
hop in
zains nose was red
i never liked school
that book is old
zain is my ex
i want some potatoes
i am getting hot
he found my bicycle
i had a premonition
she lives in kyoto
we will hurry
zain was home

zain is a bad boy
i was late to school

i have found something
its up to you
i wanted her to win
zain is ambidextrous

i was in the house
i regret going there
it is a curse
did zain get a chance
what was your major
the wind was howling
youve won
we hugged each other
where did they go
you are not normal
i am convinced
call right now

i am tired of losing
he left the door open
those are my pants
he gave me his word
we sang as we walked
we will complain

my brother feels sorry for his mistake
these dogs are big

it was just a joke
it was very strange
it’s on the tip of my tongue
he cannot stop her
do you want a salad with it
i owe zain money
weve seen worse
flowers bloom
who else uses it
hard work is the key to success
that hurts

god exists
take your pills
i am feeling sick
i am depending on you
i dont feel well

wisdom is more powerful than strength
everything went black
horses are animals
i will be your teacher
zain pulled my hair
zain winked at mary

its a brainteaser
he is good at solving math problems
do you cry often
i want it to happen
were screaming
i have had a good sleep
zain scored a goal
weve already eaten
he has no house to live in
zain was a spy

i lent my friend some money
you can trust them

he often plays guitar
i am angry with her
every dog has his day

this rarely happens
its never too late
i was the only woman

the night is dark
i am not finicky
zain knows us well
zain trusts us
that was very easy
its their right
he is always on time
zain hasnt changed

tom handed a note to mary

by god’s grace
he came about two

he doesnt know me
i was a fool
i need to rent a room
we will learn how to
shall i answer this letter for you

i love your car
we know who they are
she began to sing
i woke zain up

thats unfortunate
zain was confident

she finished her homework in an hour
so, what do you do for a living
you are unfair
i am all out of money
i heard a noise
the lovers kissed

the oranges cost 7 pence each
she made me hurry
zain threatened them

zain seems biased
she came last

he threw me the apple
i wasnt afraid
this doesnt burn
why is she here
i am not very busy
this is holy ground
it had snowed

is this suitable
zain has other plans
its all in the room
i mowed zains lawn
do you agree with tom
it really happened
please replace it
they are with me
i have made up my mind
zain remained behind
i ran a race with tom
i think you are ready
did zain go to college
you cannot do that because you are a mean and cowardly person
he is just an amateur
his love grew cold
where can i buy it
he is a poet
it really takes time
do you like pretzels
give me the spoon
do you know why
tell him to wait
i look forward to it
please sign here
he cannot stop it

i wasnt flirting
how can we prove that
both are alive
that rarely happens
zain seems bored
how much will it cost
his feet are swollen because of walking

zain looked concerned
he came in person

i have a suggestion
zain was lying to you
zain knows too much

they cant stop me
he began singing

money talks
we saved you a seat
its a good book

lace up your shoes
we are three friends sitting under the tree
thats it
its a great idea
i anticipated that
he owns this land
i am not a coward
i hope you approve
i will go on foot
i must go
what time does the next train leave
hold fire
they were satisfied
count on it
i want proof

i think zain did well
i can be good
i need surgery
put on your blinker
an ostrich cant fly
i returned to japan

i came back home late
zain paid the cashier
i dont want kids
its a good question
we traveled together
i met your friend

zain stuck up for me
any child knows that
he is mad at everyone
bees make honey
i found your diary
if he gets there before me, ask him to wait
can i extend my stay
you are still young
he loves trains
is there a reward
he got up early this morning
what is new
i have got a toothache
the ship ran aground
i hate long goodbyes
a fuse has blown
everyones different
did zain confess
our society is worsening day by day
